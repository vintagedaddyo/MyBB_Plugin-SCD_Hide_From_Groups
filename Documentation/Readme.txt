Description:			

			This plugin will hide the contents of a MyCode tagged portion of a post from any user groups selected in the SCD Hide From Groups section in the Admin CP->Configuration->Settings. It defaults to 1 (Guest). You use a comma separated list of group ids you want it to check and hide the code from. It checks both the regular gid and the additional gids of the user.
			
			
Note: if you have mycode signatures it is suggested just to also disable signature viewing for the same user groups you are using in this plugin. You can disable signatures for desired user groups in acp home > board settings > profile options
